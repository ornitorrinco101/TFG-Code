# TFG-Code
Code for my thesis on interaction of neutrinos through charged currents.

- CS-lepton-nucleon: C++ code for modeling (anti)neutrino-nucleon reactions through Charged Current, Weak Neutral Current or Electromagnetic interaction in a purely elastic model. input.txt gives values that compute the differential cross section for given lepton energies.

- CS-RFG_QE_c++: C++ code for modeling (anti)neutrino-nucleon reactions through Charged Current or Electromagnetic interaction in a Quasi-Elastic model with a given Fermi momentum dependant on element. input.txt gives values that compute the double differential cross section for given lepton energies and scattering angle.

- CS-RFG-Notable-Outputs: output later used for integration of differential cross sections for given elements and comparison with T2K experimental data.

- DATA-EXP: T2K experimental data from ND280 of quasi-elastic neutrino scattering on C8H8. Plots in R here too.

- GraÃÅficas: plot images

- T2Kflux2016: raw experimental data used for DATA-EXP plots

- .nb files: Used for confirming correct calculation of leptonic and hadronic tensors. Using FeynCalc Mathematica Library.
